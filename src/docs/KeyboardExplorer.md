# Keyboard Explorer Overview

Welcome to **Keyboard Explorer**, a fun and interactive way for children to learn the alphabet, numbers, and keyboard layouts!

## Gameplay Basics

Keyboard Explorer is designed to be a "digital playroom". There are no "wrong" answers—every key press leads to a discovery.

### How to Play

1.  **Press a Key**: Use your physical keyboard or tap any key on the on-screen keyboard.
2.  **Discover**: The screen will flash a vibrant color, and the letter/number will appear in a large, bouncing display.
3.  **Listen**: The game will speak the letter and an associated word (e.g., "A... Apple").
4.  **Repeat**:
    - Tap the **Jumping Letter** to hear its name again.
    - Tap the **Word Card** to hear the word again.

## Features

### Randomized Word Pool

Every time you open the game, a different word is assigned to each letter from a pool (e.g., "A" could be "Apple", "Ant", or "Astronaut"). This keeps the game fresh and expands vocabulary!

### Equal Color Distribution

The keyboard colors are assigned randomly from a balanced pool of 12 retro colors. No two colors will dominate the board, creating a vibrant and engaging experience.

### Child-Safe Controls

- **Immediate Response**: Buttons trigger as soon as you touch them—perfect for little fingers.
- **Lockdown**: Zooming, right-clicking, and text selection are disabled to prevent accidental "stuck" states.

## Configuration (Config Menu)

Open the **Gear Icon** in the top right to customize the experience:

- **Letter/Word Audio**: Toggle whether the game reads the letter, the word, or both.
- **Show Images**: Toggle the display of the associated word card.
- **Random Colors**: Switch between colorful keys and a classic gray look.
- **Qwerty / Alphabetical**:
  - **Qwerty**: Uses the standard computer keyboard layout.
  - **Alphabetical**: Rows are arranged A-Z, making it easier for early learners to find letters.
- **Fullscreen**: Fill the whole screen for an immersive experience.
