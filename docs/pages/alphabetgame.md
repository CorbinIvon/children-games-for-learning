# Alphabet Game: Screen Features

## Purpose

The Alphabet Game focuses on letter recognition, phonics, and the distinction between uppercase and lowercase letters. It transforms early literacy into a playful, interactive challenge.

## Interactive Game Modes

### 1. The Letter Lab (Recognition)

- **Visuals**: A large, animated letter takes center stage.
- **Interaction**: Tap the letter to cycle through uppercase and lowercase forms.
- **Phonics**: The game speaks the letter name followed by its sound (e.g., "A... says Ah").

### 2. Big & Small Match (Uppercase/Lowercase)

- **Objective**: Match the baby letter (lowercase) to its parent letter (uppercase).
- **Mechanism**: Simple tap-to-select or drag-and-drop interface.
- **Feedback**: Successfully matching letters triggers a "Star Burst" effect and a celebratory cheer.

### 3. Letter Treasure Hunt

- **Objective**: Use a "Flashlight" to find hidden letters in a scene (e.g., letters hidden in clouds or behind bushes).
- **Interaction**: Tap the hidden letter to collect it.
- **Rewards**: Collecting all letters in a set (e.g., A, B, C) unlocks a special animated reward.

## Audio & Visual Richness

- **Dynamic Rewards**: Every correct action is celebrated with retro-style particle effects and positive verbal reinforcement.
- **Phonics Integration**: Unlike the Keyboard Explorer which focused on words, this game emphasizes the _sounds_ letters make.
- **Interactive Scenery**: Tap clouds to make them rain or tap the sun to make it giggle.

## Customization & Progress

- **Level Selection**: Parents can choose to focus on vowels, specific letter groups, or the whole alphabet.
- **Difficulty Scaling**: As the child succeeds, the "Treasure Hunt" becomes slightly more challenging with more complex scenery.

## Child-Safe Design

- **Single-Taps**: No complex gestures required; everything is accessible via simple taps.
- **Sturdy Lockdown**: The same viewport and input lockdowns from the Keyboard Explorer ensure the child stays safely inside the game.
- **Settings Persistence**: Preferences for audio volume and hint frequency are saved globally.
