# Keyboard Explorer: Screen Features

## Purpose

The Keyboard Explorer is an open-ended learning environment where children can discover the relationship between physical/on-screen keys, sounds, and words. It is designed for maximum engagement through vibrant visual and audio feedback.

## Interactive Features

### 1. Multi-Input Exploration

- **Physical Keyboard**: Supports any standard alphanumeric key press.
- **On-Screen Keyboard**: A colorful, tap-friendly layout that mimics a real keyboard.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Buttons trigger instantly on touch (on-press) to accommodate children with slower click speeds or developing motor skills.

### 2. Multi-Sensory Feedback

- **Visual**:
  - The screen flashes a vibrant retro color matching the pressed key.
  - The pressed character appears as a large, bouncing graphic on the screen.
  - A "Word Card" appears above the keyboard showing a related word.
- **Audio**:
  - High-quality text-to-speech reads the letter/number.
  - For letters, the game also reads an associated word (e.g., "B... Bear").
  - Numbers are read clearly as their names ("Zero" to "Nine").

### 3. Interactive Replay

- **Repeat Letter**: Tapping the large bouncing character on the screen repeats its name.
- **Repeat Word**: Tapping the word card repeats the associated word.
- **Visual Haptics**: Elements grow or shrink slightly when tapped to provide visual confirmation.

## Customization & Modes

### 4. Smart Keyboard Layouts

- **QWERTY Mode**: Displays the standard computer layout to build familiarity with real hardware.
- **Alphabetical Mode**: Rearranges keys into a simple A-Z order, ideal for early learners who are just learning the alphabet sequence.

### 5. Configurable Experience

Through the configuration menu, parents can toggle:

- **Audio Modes**: Read letters only, words only, or both.
- **Visuals**: Show or hide word cards and toggle between random colors or classic gray.
- **Environment**: Fullscreen mode for an immersive, distraction-free experience.

## Child-Safe Design

- **Input Lockdown**: Double-tap zooming and pinch-to-zoom are disabled.
- **Interaction Lockdown**: Right-click menus and text selection are blocked to prevent the app from getting into "stuck" states.
- **Persistent Settings**: All configuration choices are automatically saved and will be remembered across sessions.
