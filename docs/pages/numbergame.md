# Numbers Game: Screen Features

## Purpose

The Numbers Game introduces early numeracy concepts, including counting, number recognition, and basic sequences. It uses tangible visual objects to make abstract numbers "real" for young learners.

## Interactive Game Modes

### 1. Count the Objects

- **Visuals**: A random number of colorful objects (apples, ducks, stars) appear on screen.
- **Interaction**: Tap each object to count it. As each object is tapped, it changes color or animates, and the game speaks the number (1, 2, 3...).
- **Goal**: Reach the final number to see it appear in large, glowing digits!

### 2. Pop the Counting Bubbles

- **Objective**: Pop bubbles in numerical order (1 -> 2 -> 3).
- **Mechanism**: Tapping bubbles triggers a satisfying "pop" sound and visual splash.
- **Learning**: Helps reinforce the sequence of numbers and hand-eye coordination.

### 3. Number Shape Drawing

- **Interaction**: Trace the number shape with a finger or mouse.
- **Feedback**: A "Magic Trail" follows the input. Completing the shape correctly triggers a "Neon Light" effect, making the number glow and dance.

## Audio & Visual Richness

- **Visual Counting**: Numbers aren't just digits; they are represented by quantities of objects, helping children understand _value_.
- **Celebratory Chimes**: Reaching a counting goal plays a triumphant melody.
- **Tactile Effects**: Objects react to touch—ducks quack, stars twinkle, and bubbles pop!

## Customization & Modes

- **Number Range**: Limit the game to 1-5 for beginners, or expand up to 1-20 for more advanced learners.
- **Object Themes**: Choose between "Nature" (bugs/flowers), "Space" (planets/stars), or "Toys".

## Child-Safe Design

- **Mistake-Proof**: If a child pops bubbles out of order, the game gently highlights the _right_ bubble rather than penalizing the child.
- **Input Lockdown**: Complete protection against accidental system menus or zooming.
- **Global Settings**: Volume and difficulty levels persist across all Number game sessions.
