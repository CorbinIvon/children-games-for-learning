# Words Game: Screen Features

## Purpose

The Words Game builds vocabulary and early spelling skills through picture association and simple letter-slot puzzles. It bridges the gap between recognizing letters and understanding full words.

## Interactive Game Modes

### 1. The Missing Letter

- **Visuals**: A clear image (e.g., a "Dog") and the word with a missing first letter (`_ O G`).
- **Interaction**: Three letter bubbles float by. Tap the correct letter to complete the word.
- **Phonics Support**: Tap the image to hear the word; tap the slots to hear the phonics.

### 2. Picture Matcher

- **Objective**: Match the written word card to the correct image.
- **Interaction**: Drag the word card into the target zone.
- **Learning**: Reinforces word recognition and meaning through visual cues.

### 3. Word Balloon Bash

- **Objective**: Bash the balloons that contain objects of a certain category (e.g., "Find all the FRUITS").
- **Interaction**: Tapping a balloon pops it. Correct items are celebrated, while incorrect items simply bounce away.

## Audio & Visual Richness

- **Word Pronunciation**: Every word is read aloud by a clear, friendly voice upon completion.
- **Animated Victories**: Completing a word makes the image "come to life" (e.g., the dog barks and wags its tail).
- **Categorization**: Use of color-coded categories (Animals = Green, Fruits = Red, etc.) to help with visual learning.

## Customization & Modes

- **Vocabulary Packs**: Parents can select specific packs like "Animals", "Home Objects", "Colors", or "Shapes".
- **Hint System**: Toggleable hints that show the letter outline if the child waits too long.

## Child-Safe Design

- **Immediate Response**: Buttons and drag zones are large and forgiving, triggering immediately on contact.
- **Global Lockdown**: The same robust protection from accidental interactions found in all Kiddo Quest games.
- **Persistent Progress**: The last played vocabulary pack is remembered sessions.
